				How many times have you met friends at a micro-brewery and were confused by the beer selections and beer-nerd related descriptions?   We have simplified the process, by taking a brief survey where you rank beers you like in a 5 start scale Beertentious will recommend beers you are likely to enjoy.  So next time you are faced with a beer list that looks like an ancient elements table written in flemish, just pull out your phone and type in the brewery location.  Using a huge database Beertentious will then recommend several beers.  Easy as that!!!
