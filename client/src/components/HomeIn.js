				How many times have you met friends at a micro-brewery and were confused by the beer selections and beer-nerd related descriptions? We have simplified the process - by taking a brief survey where you rank beers you like in a 5 star scale, Beertentious will recommend beers you're likely to enjoy.  So the next time you're faced with a beer list that looks like an ancient elements table written in Flemish, just pull out your phone and type in the brewery location.  Using a huge database Beertentious will then recommend several beers.  Easy as that!!!
