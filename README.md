# Beertenious

Beertenious is a beer recommendation application.  The beer recommendation begins with the user loging in to create a profile.  Once the profile is created the user is asked to rate the beers via a 1-5 start rating system.  Based on the user input then a list of recommended beers is generated based on the user geographical input.
